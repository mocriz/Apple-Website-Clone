# 🍎 Apple Website Clone

During Ramadan, I spent my free time building a project called **Apple Website Clone** to sharpen my front-end development skills.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML**: Used for page structure and content.
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS used to implement the accordion in the mobile footer.
- **TailwindCSS + CSS**: Styling with TailwindCSS as the main framework and a touch of vanilla CSS where necessary.
- **Resources**: Images are sourced from Apple's official site. Fonts are taken from [this repository](https://github.com/gattadesmond/hugo-foundation6/tree/master).
